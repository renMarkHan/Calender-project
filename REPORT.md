# CS3035 â€“ Course Project Description

## Description of Your Project

Below, provide a short description of what your project is, how it works, and why you selected this as your project.



## Requirements

- How/What different views did you provide for some aspect of your model?
```diff
- We provided a splash screen as the project description demonstrated.
- In case that this is an Ultimate To Do App, with calendar based, of course. Then we also have a Calendar View here.
- Also we need to have 5 domain objects ("Events" in our case), so we must provide the corresponding interfaces to let users add/delete/modify them. 
  Then we created various add/modify views for those events. 
  Plus a To-Do list view if the user clicks a specific cell (aka. Date) on the calendar.
- All of our views are presented in the fxml form because it's easier and I'm an XML/CSS expert :)
```

- What custom widget did you create in your application?
```diff
- We created a Calendar widget, you can see it after the splash screen.
- We also created an Event List widget, used in the calendar cells and in the To-Do List page. In order to present the events to the user.
```

- What are the different domain objects that can be created/edited in 
your application?
```diff
- We have five domain objects, they are all considered as different type of "events".
- The five events are: Tasks, holidays, birthdays, appointments, and other (events).
```
- What parts of the application/project did you find particularly challenging? 
And, what would you have liked to improve?
```diff
 - How can we implement the calendar class in Java as an interface (calendar widget)?
 - It seems like we forgot the SQL knowledge, spend a lot of time relearning how to build and write in a database.
 - Originally, we want to combine those controllers, there are just too many of them. But we failed to do so (lack of time).
```

- Any other comments on the course mini project?
```diff
 - I personally think we have very limited time for completing this project.
   Should've opened the project after reading week or even before the reading week.
