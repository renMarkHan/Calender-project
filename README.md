- only one submission needed per group, see the project deliverables below

## Project Description
In this project you will put what you have learned in class into practice, 
and extend what you have learned to create a desktop app that allows creating, 
editing and deleting different domain objects.

The project can be completed individually or in a group (see below).

## Due Date 
***December 10, 2020***

## Individual or Groups (optional) 

Your group can be completed individually or in a group consisting of 2-4 team 
members. If you need assistance finding a group, please post a message to 
the Questions channel on Teams.

Working in a group can be tough, but it is your job to ensure that the all 
team members contribute to the project equally. Communicating openly and 
early with your teammates is key to success. You must make sure you dedicate 
time to work on your project and communicate with your teammates about when 
and what you will do. Everyone gets busy, so make sure you plan for 
contingencies when estimating your time and commitments to your team; if you
 get busy with other responsibilities or you get stuck (which is always likely), 
 you need to have a plan.

## Requirements

You will select an application area for your project that is of interest to you, but that fulfills the 
requirements below.

### Implementation Requirements

 - You will use/adapt the sketching methods discussed in class to your project 
 (see slides from our sketching lecture; you can use a 5+5 method)
 - Your application must use an MVC design
 - Your
 -  application should provide at least two different views for some aspect of your model
 - Your application should have a splash screen, a menu bar (with appropriate content), a Help menu
	- The Help Menu should include a Help Screen, and an About that Displays your team's "company logo" 
	and team members
 - Your application must provide a consistent and appropriate look and feel (i.e., colors, fonts, etc.) 
 for your project 
 - Your application should contain at least one custom designed widget that appropriately allows you to 
 enter/display information about some aspect of your domain objects 
 - Your application should allow interacting and entering model information for at least 3 different 
 types of domain objects (+1 for each additional group member; e.g., groups of 3 should have 5 types)
 - Domain objects should be able to be created, edited/updated/changed and deleted as appropriate 
 through user or system actions
 - Provide a set of exemplary domain objects that are pre-populated in your application
   - Your application does not need to save its updated state when it is closed (i.e., the system 
   will return to its original state upon restarting)
 - Be creative - some points will be reserved for the complexity/creativity of the projects, but
  do not go too far 
 
### Example Project Ideas

 - A simple Image Editor
 - A sprite/pixel editor/paint app
 - A media organization/player app
 - The ultimate todo app
 - A personal budgeting app
 - A simple 2D RPG game
 - A tool to create RPG characters or plan simple campaigns
 - A data charting tool... enter data and create charts
 - Recreate an app you like in JavaFX
 - Your own idea! If in doubt check with Scott.

### Project Deliverables
 - a AUTHORS.md file including the name of all group members and important details on your submission
 - only one submission per group, just make sure all group members names are in the AUTHORS.md file. 

 - app.images/photos of all sketches that were used to plan the applications design, use sticky notes 
 to describe how you used these to guide your final design, copy these into the sketches folder in 
 your submission... edit the SKETCHES.md file to describe the app.images.
 - do your best to make sure all sketch app.images are easily legible (well lit and can be easily seen)
 - a short one-page report describing your project, available in REPORT.md
 - a video demonstration of your app (no longer than 3.5 mins long, if it's shorter that's fine). 
 The video can be narrated, but should demonstrate all the main functionality of your app. Upload 
 your videos to Streams and share the link in your README.md file. Make sure that it is viewable by 
 anyone who has the link.

## Resources
 - [JavaFX Splash Screen](https://www.genuinecoder.com/javafx-splash-screen-loading-screen/)

## Assessment

 - Points will be awarded based on meeting the requirements above, providing a fully working, bug/error free system that follows basic principles of usability discussed in the lectures.
  
 - A small portion of the projects grade will be awarded for creativity/complexity of your project (~10%)
 
## Help with Git
 - To get new files in this project into Git, you will need to make sure that they are added to the project, 
 before you commit and push. You can always copy files from your computer and paste them through IntelliJ.
 - If you right-click on the project directory in the Project Tab, you can go to "Git-> +Add", which should add any 
 new files to your project. 
 - Some additional instructions on how to use Git for your project will be given during class time.
